Benefits of the Program

    -Allows for quicker and better communication between mechanics/employees and customers
    -The customers get quicker more personalized responses
    -Each mechanic/employee saves about 15 minutes a day, and spared their annoyance at finding customers' contacts
     and with 10 mechanics working each week - my program has saved the business and its employers

                    TIME SAVED CALCULATIONS

    -480 hours a week - worked ~ 10 employees and the 2 owners
    -15 mins * 12 employees * 7 days = 1260 minutes saved a week (21 hours a week)
    -Total percentage saved (21/480) = 4.375% SAVED EACH WEEK
